# M-VAST 3

A desktop application for administering the M-VAST 3 (Michigan Visual Aversion Stress Test).

## Overview

This repository contains the complete M-VAST 3 platform, including source code, image assets, and comprehensive documentation. M-VAST 3 is a research tool designed to present visual stimuli and collect subjective ratings from participants in controlled experimental settings.

## Repository Contents

- **`mvast3.py`** - Core Python application
- **`mvast3_manual.html`** - Complete user guide (open in any web browser)
- **`images/`** - Default images and sample stimuli

## Installation

Choose one of the installation methods below. **Option A** is recommended for beginners who are new to programming or command line tools.

### Option A: Simple Installation (Recommended for Beginners)

**Best for users unfamiliar with programming or the terminal**

#### Step 1: Download the Files
1. Click the green **Code** button on this GitHub page
2. Select **Download ZIP**
3. Extract the downloaded `mvast3-main.zip` file to your Desktop or Documents folder
4. Remember where you saved it!

#### Step 2: Install Python

**On Windows:**
1. Open Command Prompt (search for "cmd" in the Start menu)
2. Type `python` and press Enter
3. This will open the Microsoft Store where you can install Python
4. Click "Install" and wait for it to complete

**On Mac:**
1. Go to [python.org/downloads](https://python.org/downloads)
2. Download and install the latest version of Python
3. Follow the installation prompts

#### Step 3: Navigate to the Downloaded Files
You need to tell your computer where to find the M-VAST 3 files.

**On Windows:**
1. Open Command Prompt (search for "cmd" in the Start menu)
2. Type `cd Desktop\mvast3-main` (if you saved it to Desktop) or `cd Documents\mvast3-main` (if you saved it to Documents)
3. Press Enter

**On Mac:**
1. Open Terminal (search for "Terminal" in Spotlight)
2. Type `cd Desktop/mvast3-main` (if you saved it to Desktop) or `cd Documents/mvast3-main` (if you saved it to Documents)
3. Press Enter

**How to check you're in the right place:**
- On Windows: type `dir` and press Enter
- On Mac: type `ls` and press Enter

You should see these three items listed:
- `images`
- `mvast3.py`
- `mvast3_manual.html`

If you don't see these files, you're in the wrong folder. Try navigating to where you actually saved the extracted files.

#### Step 4: Install Required Packages
In the same terminal/command prompt window, type this command:

```bash
python -m pip install pygame pillow numpy ttkbootstrap
```

**If you get an error saying "python is not recognized":**
- Try using `python3` instead: `python3 -m pip install pygame pillow numpy ttkbootstrap`
- Use `python3` for all future commands if `python` doesn't work

#### Step 5: Run the Application
```bash
python mvast3.py
```

Or if `python` doesn't work:
```bash
python3 mvast3.py
```

The M-VAST 3 application window should now open!

### Option B: Python Virtual Environment (Standard)

**Best for users comfortable with Python development**

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/brockpluimer/mvast3.git
   cd mvast3
   ```

2. **Set up virtual environment**
   ```bash
   # Create virtual environment
   python -m venv mvast3
   
   # Activate (Windows)
   .\mvast3\Scripts\activate
   
   # Activate (macOS/Linux)
   source mvast3/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install pygame pillow numpy ttkbootstrap
   ```

4. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   python mvast3.py
   ```

### Option C: Conda Environment (For Researchers)

**Best for scientific computing and research environments**

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/brockpluimer/mvast3.git
   cd mvast3
   ```

2. **Create Conda environment**
   ```bash
   conda create -n mvast3 -c conda-forge python=3.9 pillow numpy pygame ttkbootstrap
   ```
   Type `y` when prompted to proceed.

3. **Activate environment**
   ```bash
   conda activate mvast3
   ```

4. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   python mvast3.py
   ```

## Troubleshooting

**"Python is not recognized" error:**
- Try using `python3` instead of `python` in all commands
- Make sure Python is properly installed

**"No module named..." error:**
- Make sure you ran the pip install command in the correct directory
- Try the install command again

**Can't find the files:**
- Make sure you extracted the ZIP file
- Use `dir` (Windows) or `ls` (Mac) to check what's in your current folder
- Navigate to the correct folder using `cd` command

**Still having trouble?**
- Double-check that when you type `dir` (Windows) or `ls` (Mac), you see the three items: `images`, `mvast3.py`, and `mvast3_manual.html`
- Make sure you're in the mvast3-main folder
